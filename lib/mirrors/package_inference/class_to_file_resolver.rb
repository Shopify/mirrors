    # Resolves a Class ({ClassMirror}) to a path on disk using various
    # heuristics.
    #
    # Our preferred path is to use the data recorded by the +TracePoint+
    # registered by {Mirrors::Init}, if it was +required+ early enough to
    # capture data on the provided class, but we have some fallback heuristics
    # too.

      # Attempt to resolve a {ClassMirror} to a single path on disk which
      # corresponds to its primary definition site.
      #
      # The +TracePoint+ registered in {Init} captures the filename each time a
      # class is opened. If this class was only opened once, we can simply
      # return that filepath.
      #
      # If it wasn't registered by {Init::CLASS_DEFINITION_TRACEPOINT} or if it
      # was opened more than once, we find the source file for each instance
      # and class method defined on the module, and look for text in that file
      # that looks like +class FooBar+ -- e.g. explicitly opening the class.
      # This is because many libraries will add instance methods to an argument
      # using dynamic APIs (e.g. +target.define_method(...)+)
      #
      # Failing that strategy, we choose whichever file contained the most
      # instance or class methods for this module.
      #
      # If we weren't able to determine a source location for any methods, and
      # didn't track class creation (as may be the case for some core classes
      # or C extensions), we simply return +nil+.
      #
      # @param [ClassMirror] cm the {ClassMirror} for which to determine a
      #   filename.
